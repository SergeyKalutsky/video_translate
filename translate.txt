Useful It will help you become a genius
talent, don't be surprised by this
this and the video This book is definitely
Not an exaggerated content
today's book will really tell you
respond to a belief as well as a method
the way you can from an average person
often become an outstanding person
than one who excels in one field
a certain area or become a master
What kind of skill is an expert really good at?
yes and this is the book pick
secretan the expertys
High secret from new specialist science
by two authors anders erizen thanks to psychology
swedish professor of psychology
at Florida State University and with author
pseudoscience robotics
Now let's learn together
About the content of this book
we are not far from the genius
When it comes to geniuses, they must be
I will immediately think of musical genius
Mozart Only 7 years old Mozart organized it
a big concert makes it all
the music world must be amazed
But even more amazing at 4
The age that you bought it with can already be distinguished
The tone of any sound is powerful
this force until today it
still called extremely rare, it is estimated that every
the ability is like buying skin the ability of
Mozart is always a great example when
we talk about natural talent and
People often think that Genius
are those who are born with inherent capital
give yourself a power over a competent person
That would be for the average person
never achieved but the truth
Is that so, Dr.?
erickson has passed research and development
The path to becoming a genius is revealed
by Mozart
The reason why I achieved such a high achievement
it's not because you were born
was a genius because he had a
The father is a very talented composer
along with that, Mozart's father was very nice
attach importance to the education of his children first
fostering Mozart's sister though
not very successful but
His daughter is also an artist after
that has more experience than he has fostered
for the second son that is Mozart
Finally got Mozart in
success and fame together Because
So Mozart's genius is real
Quality is the result of training
training and practicing from a very young age
small or in the world of music of
the violin the name of the three kanini
always go with the title of Genius
This story started in one day
performing when 3 strings were broken he
used one string and still finished
the rhythm is perfect and correct
This event made him
Legend in the history of music
But the real version is him for bringing
love a woman should be bright
Make a song for the one you love
great with just two strings, two strings
hey it simulates sweet dialogue
of two people in love then he
Practiced this song because
been practiced before, so it's a session
Even if he's been performing, he's still broken
can be successful when playing with only
a string
Through the research the author has developed
discovered that the reason why people care
Think of Geniuses as those who were born
more capable than people The reason is because
asymmetrical information
spread and people are attracted again
love to go to myths
more mysterious but the propagandists they
will be based on multiple motives only taking the
The most shocking footage and skips the
Daily details make us
think that genius is born good
than everyone else And they succeed
without too much effort all these
Genius on the surface seems to be
their powers are beyond reach
with ordinary people but in reality
they all have the same secret
only to become more talented than people
it's deliberate practice
And what differentiates them from the average person?
What is usually They always practice in the same way
systematic method to help yourself
continuously cross the comfort zone and open
widen their circle of competence Though here
The author does not deny the factors
genetically, but the study of
he actually overturned this conception and
let us know that we
not too far away on genius just
know how to practice deliberately
Everyone has the opportunity to be different and
Excellent That's why the first thing is
have faith that just the right way
practice we can definitely
become brilliant and excelled
more
Did you notice this fact when
we learn some new skill
Usually we will follow the
The basic steps are as follows, first we
I'll find out what I'm going to do
start learning from the teacher from the training school
good book trainer is the website then
Then we'll start practicing
practice until you reach a level
acceptability and use
them in practice automatically
chemistry but here you need to understand a
It is very important that once the skill
your reach a level where yourself
If you feel satisfied, then it's very difficult
can make further progress we usually
Misunderstanding like this for that is if
let's go on and on
practice their inherent skills They
We will definitely get better even if we make progress
no matter how slow it is but they
We are still on the way to developing an example
We often assume that doctors act
Medical profession with 10 years experience will be better
compared to a doctor who has been practicing for 5 years or one
20 years old teachers will be better
The teacher has been in the class for 5 years but
In fact, that's not the case
Research in this book shows
once someone's level has been reached
acceptable level and it can
automatically change to Culture then work
we practice it for a few more years
won't improve many skills
your doctor even has teachers
10 15 years experience member but not yet
must be equal to new workers 5
five or seven years because if we
without the intention to improve, the possibilities
automation skills that you have practiced
The previous episode will gradually degrade
So to be able to become a person
really excellent we have to be intentional
To practice means to have a sense of desire
get out of this level of automation and
purposeful practice
So what is purposeful practice?
Here we need to grasp 4 characteristics
The important point of purposeful practice
The purpose is as follows. The first feature has the item
specific and clearly defined goals
It's like in the book 7 Habits
to succeed that I talked about in the video
Before we do anything, we
need to get the ultimate target to catch
the beginning and the purposeful practice of
we are here it should be like that
First you need to have big goals ie
long-term goals and then practice
in the style of small to large steps
Small steps first to reach the path
long ie let's break down the item
goals in the book, the author has done
an experiment on memory training
that participant is an average person
Usually, at first, I can only remember about 8
number then through practice each time has
Define and break down your goals gradually
Start improving your abilities every
times remember 9 numbers then 10 numbers and so on and
and finally he got it
Unbelievable achievement is being able to remember
get 82 numbers and break down the goal
It is also the process that helps us to
The final correction review is that there are
breakthrough for its own characteristics
Second, I need to focus like I did
say a lot of the previous videos like
like a video about the secret of life
stevenfox it's the first to live simply
the second is focus, focus is
key element in mindfulness one
Life experiences make you happy and
Take control of your life and focus Great
For is also the way for you to achieve flow
the state of flow makes you
work and live better and continue in
This book is like that, the author has
emphasize that to be successful you do not
can't focus completely on one
The only thing at the moment is practice
a skill too. This is one thing
required If you want to progress you
must be fully focused every time
The third characteristic of my practice is
There must be feedback no matter what you do
if you just bury your head and do it
don't stop to look to give feedback
to myself that in what aspect I
Am I missing something in what I do?
well you won't be able to find it
what you need to improve and also not
I know I'm still far from the finish line
how far is the best way when forging
Practice a skill and you'll find it
I'm a teacher, I'm a trainer
member Because a teacher is not just
the teacher instructs you more
is a person you can give
You give the most objective feedback from there
can progress quickly
but in our case
It is not possible to have a teacher by your side
next to it, you will definitely have to find it yourself
how to self-reflection self-modifying
and finally an important feature
no less it is to pass the circle comfortably
This feature is really a truth
The ultimate for any kind of workout
if you are not disciplined enough to force you
I stepped out of my comfort zone
you will never make progress
getting out of your comfort zone means you
must try to do something
I have never done it before and
These things will initially make you
I feel uncomfortable even scared
afraid to face but once
that you overcame this obstacle?
will grasp the key key in
Practice with purpose and just draw
rhythm with this rhythm then
can definitely make a real breakthrough
Believe in yourself for adaptability
of the brain is limitless
ordinary people when practicing
The exercise may experience stagnation
i.e. feel no further growth
okay, but for geniuses
not so you need to know that most
The so-called stagnation is all hindrance
afraid of the mentality that you imagine
Just in fact, you never got it
I got my limit just because of you
There's not enough Motivation to make it through
stop scientific research has discovered
that the adaptability of the brain exceeds
far from the perception of an ordinary person
The following study will demonstrate
we see this in London's
I have a lot of the most complicated roads
world so this city has a request
extremely strict towards their drivers
must pass a qualified test
It's the hardest thing in the world
Driver's license test requires them
must remember and say all the names correctly
Roads are important landmarks and there are
The exercise must find the shortest path
from a location A to a location B and
Scientists have conducted research
the brains of London drivers when they
moved and discovered that the area
related to memory in their brain
was a lot bigger than before the exam
Did you know that the scientific world used to
assume that the adult brain is close to
as fixed but the study of the
taxi drivers and the visual region of the brain
The blind have overturned this perception
substance is that our brain has the ability
infinitely adaptable that's why the
The world record is constantly being overturned
Besides the brain, the human body
We are also very adaptable
strong but the body will have
direction prefers stability and when you press
If it steps out of its comfort zone,
The body system will feel pressured because of the
Its original balance is at stake
as once the body has begun to respond
get new changes, then the balance
hey it will gradually be rebuilt
For example, do you exercise?
limit your body Initially it will have
Unfamiliar situations do not like
If you can do it, you will find it very difficult
difficult but then you just keep working
If you exercise, your body will change
change in different ways to like
cope with this and the more challenging
The bigger you are, the stronger the transformation will be
increase the difficulty level in the exercises
The more you exercise, the more you will reap
even better health outcomes
my endurance or my physique In short
is that you need to know adaptability
of the brain is infinite. That's why they
We need to find enough for ourselves
motivation to practice attentively with each
Step through the comfort zone and challenge
Consciousness of Victory over yourself
Actually you and genius are different in
spiritual symbol
The difference between normal people and
master is the difference in the symbol
spirit in this book, they
we will see the phrase spiritual symbol
And it's especially focused on saying
that the main purpose of the practice part
intended to create crystal symbols
efficiency means excellent person
The expert players have the reason why they have become
public is because they have the expressions
mental image better than human
normal and especially they are not
Stop practicing and optimize your expressions
this spiritual statue
So what is the spiritual symbol here?
I think it's this book
This concept is not well explained
roughly it just says that this is a
mental texture this did
I was really wondering And then I
went to look it up and in the end I
found its origin in knowledge
of cognitive psychology this is a

by the following model: acquisition, processing, and storage

or a video you are listening to
batter it is all information that is
received when it has not been received by us
learn it is called symbols
beyond the set when it is our brain

our internal image and here also
is the spiritual symbol that says one
otherwise all knowledge structures
stored in your brain
are all your spiritual symbols You
how many spiritual symbols and
how its quality will decide

once said that the biggest difference between
person to person is the difference from part

The spirit in each person can say that the whole

this spiritual symbol it will spin
in turn it determines how they are
We understand this knowledge in a way
different from these spiritual symbols

we should therefore ask why there are so
Many of my friends used to see books when they were in school

we never had icons
