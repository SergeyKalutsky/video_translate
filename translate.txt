[Music] Welcome to the blanket lying listening to people and there is a sentence that
I very much remember that it is we can choose a wife choose a husband but our children cannot choose a father choose a mother so
choose a good partner and if you are a good partner please let us join you
come up with some incredibly amazing sand foam along with Xiang Xiang and he led destination Hello all of you and today very
is glad to invite tool to tell a topic that really it suits me because I am also generally well
I just got married earlier this year so I had some experience saying that's all but waiting for someone to get it
hopefully today will be shared with everyone some good things and will also be heard a lot
stuff the tool but first we'll go to bed together
at the moment there are many couples in love she often commits suicide saying no
knowing if his beloved is suitable to become his future partner he is also a person
but there is a very beautiful love I guess you understand this problem more than tool is a lot and now I ask permission to ask you
x-lease the first sentence that is the criterion when you choose a lover is different from the criterion when you choose
how do you marry or marry someone before you love or marry someone
or is there a kind of Ok I will set a lot of criteria she must be like this and that and that to the bottle but give
at some point it was like there was a demon of love running to him holding the child he shot the right one at that time
starting to look at each other I love it is no longer the norm of nutrition if called to from a girl that I am
to love a girl who can be a wife I think it has only one thing I use the word
commitment and not knowing yourself it is a kind of commitment like you know love it will not be
for example you and someone else fall in love right it's not going to go through the stage where Heart Meets it crushes
I turn on I turn on it constantly force it to go through a period called love it is peaceful return to it
returning to the point of balance it was almost as if I didn't have the feeling of standing near her and starting to read it first
honestly many people at that stage decided to break up because they thought it was that it was no longer
love too when it comes to that stage begins man will give up someone will perceive it as a habit
being used to life is like your arms and legs that is to say that now being together has little heart for you
I didn't read much but when I started I was apart and I felt like who cut off my arm and leg
in extreme need I often encourage people to go to that stage to think
to get started seriously with a wife or to marry as a husband is to be at that stage
this is the stage in which you will no longer be controlled by your heart and all that is your reason
your mind does everything about her not because of your heart anymore because of your ego your responsibility
your love that person yours all that it constitutes a thing that is the norm
as a wife it has no standard for you to be a wife but do you have a commitment to try to be with each other
for life or for no reason in the TV sister to decide that this is his wife
it will have moments it shows you that this is a girl who tries to fight with her
I accept change with me but that is enough that for a relationship to be good it takes time
patience and you both have to love each other I was born and raised in Hanoi so
that's what my parents and grandparents influenced me that's a lot because of the Northern people that I see as
they have a so called very strong family education and my grandfather is someone who tells us
at first my grandfather said that the latter marry the most important is the virtue I see the problem that leaves a person
if you can be your partner is your moral issue important or not
the question of my friend morality it's important not to say my partner agrees If I'm a child
the person who lives is very moral but with a partner he is a person who does not accept the values of living in
That Germany of their own they like other values for example that you are a British person who will not do anything
Violating an ethic it's too big or it affects anyone but if you marry someone he says
to me that you need money you can do anything you can cheat not generally
[music] just changed about you just say ok, but it's the opposite if you
being a student I will change everything and I also become deceived like hue it is very
it is important to love someone and to marry someone it changes a moral value in the end we too
it would be called change to adapt we are all so forced to change to adapt but if
I change positively too beautifully but I change negatively my whole life sometimes
and one of the ways in which you can recognize a person as having virtue or not is that you can
it's about seeing how they treat people who are weaker than themselves isn't it like treating old people and children
treating you as servants for example is also a way for us to observe a person as having virtue or
it doesn't depend on whether the body is tall or not spiritually right
it's going to have one that's whether you have a partner but the energy you emit is knowing you right away or feeling the energy
that amount but if you don't feel that energy then there is one way that is to go head to head and love at the same time
in those times when people love so much they open their gaps and themselves when they love themselves must
one thing is for sure that I give myself a certain percentage so that if something happens I will definitely not suffer
pain falling suicide or such problems many people love to bring themselves out completely and weakly
there is always nothing to give to say that one hears that when Love is to love with all its heart is wrong
Yes I am very curious that you fell in love with each other from the age of 18 then I brought you PG to the family debut and when did you
knowing what is in the 3rd grade means knowing three children who share a math class at Le Quy Don Specialist School
Khanh Hoa Thinh's father was the president of the parent association and then I Knew You Were Famous as Bad Boy
it's kind of like it's actually nothing but it's not that I've never accepted a life of poison
so just being kicked one is that I am 100% sure that I have to go to find new girls generally within about
the time from 9th grade 12th grade his best FA period is around 3 4 days which is also because so Asia so is
such believers it comes to whom dad should be called to face me step into boring is very scary but
luckily there's no such thing as a very clever thing that is for a while before you walk
coming home to launch what proved to my father that he was a very good person and the Demon was very serious
well this one I also share one thing that is actually the perspective of parents with the lover of
I am 100% because of me so many people often think that is why my mother hates you Dad I hate you while
I haven't met this or that most of it is because I'm not saying it is because of myself what is the person in the middle of this
that is why there is a contradiction between the other two and you too you are very
wise for the thing is first for the thing is that you managed with your mother think though I love you like that
bla bla also thanks to this so it is lucky how both sides of his family now intend to see you very little
a case in Nha Trang but the TV family considers him as his own child and his family name also considers TV as his child
gut but the most important thing is that the first session after that premiere of course I will ask you
that is what my parents say to me right not very clever is the voice of their parents say when
I love 5152 and I'm going to share it as if I don't believe it because it's basically a launch
my children are married so I just kept saying the right thing I remember always being together and learning to say it is that it consists of
many ideas I feel thinking a lot is to focus on learning Darling is also common only positive negative ideas are
you know I know you until the 9th year you propose what kind of skin Do You Think You have
over the years I've proven to both of our families that we can do it and that we're rich together
it's like making money together being happy together everything Living Dead together and so it's
after that when everything is independent then parents have no one who does not love now this guy loves his child
it's been 9 years since he and his children have been earning income and buying gifts for his family
and if we do that then everything is so we are fortunate that at the end of the day
but what we sign under marriage is what we find out about your partner's family is important
if you don't see a lot of people they think that the one you hear the most is that you marry me
I'm not going to marry your cheeks you hear that right but it's really the family of a very important person because every
people outside people think that well now marrying is the same for example the family does not accept it then he pulls
I'm hiding but it's hard I'm marrying someone with a supportive family and every person with few families
support and especially when I'm a man I know when I'm a man I'm a man for example my family and my wife are in conflict
I really don't know who to choose as a husband to choose between
and those parents are two values that can not be compared can not be made I choose who I am also
one guy is incompetent or unreasonable there is nothing that dies but the problem is that often you have the thought is
I married this person and no one bathed the family is just because you are so in love because you are so in love so everything is fine
but by the time the two of them began to come back alone and began to take the first heavy first methods at that time
first finding a family is a problem for example he said simply a girl decides to be from the family side to follow
that guy if someday that guy has something that changes who he is today with him
yesterday it was different then now change so start she saw oh boy it's too bad and now I want
like going back to mom for example he and his wife quarreled his wife ran back to mom now mom is no longer mother from the face always now
now how should it be that the study and the family are very important and have the acceptance of both sides of the family
for such a long period of time it is not simply to prepare
where is our love and it's a proof of my family and it's extremely important to me
after that when you have a lover and you decide to be a lover that will become your partner then I am sure
the first one is to be able to empathize with them the second Monday to be seen by you
do their cousins treat each other kindly or what kind of person their parents are because of us
what is it like to be born and grow up like a blank sheet of paper when I am with my family twenty years after
I'm separated from myself the part of the personality it will also affect more or less right don't you acknowledge for example the type
a person who is born into a family that is kind will more or less know how to apologize know how to thank yes
people who are born into the family of Thieves tails robbers and always learn the way is to blame others and
my fault is never my fault it's all about everything and their parents will be gone
problems such as stealing is normal or everyone is a bad person but more or less it
it will also affect but I believe that somewhere in our lives it is a life and a thing
about it is very diverse and there will be so many you were born and raised in a family that it is not good for
but after a while you get bigger more mature and know more they'll be able to
it's important to change yourself to be a better person so it's important to learn about your family
but it is unlikely that their family is not good that they were not good but that he has some chip to be able to look
more profoundly, when I look at this family, I know if this person is studying or not
In fact sharing the truth with me is that when you observe a person's path it is not for you to decide whether to stop
whether you love them or not you decide to consider that they have something that can affect you I can change
it or not for example you say that her family is a small family and something will tell you to leave it
come on you broke up you got divorced you got divorced why are you so or is it a family that kind of can start having if I
there is money that they will constantly borrow me now or maybe my mother in law will borrow money I will not give it then the problem is that I must know
it is very clear that such problems for me to anticipate then I have principles I will set
the previous principles for example my brother a month I only earn this much then I must be sure that if
like my family is defaulted or something I will support you to the extent that I can give you everything for example
like you then I can give my family a million I can lend a million I won't give more if
as if beyond that which I am angry with you for divorce I will not accept and therefore force myself to give very
many of the principles and you it will have to give you will have to Follow that principle because you have to measure
in the face of that love I want to protect this girl right but I also have to protect that happiness
by these principles I must say before I anticipate it and also to make sure if there is one
what happened I didn't have a reputation for losing meaning I said it and not now I haven't said it yet
this is always about living with the rules of friendship love family or all the relationships or work always
there is always a rule that says once yes to you what do you think about the subject of registration for
Once Upon a time they said marry somebody be the clouds that meet the clouds for example now you are born and
growing up in a family where family is very pretty you yourself are rich do you accept to marry a woman that has
virtue but their family is very poor no Oh now you say honestly women have virtue it is 1 million more precious
without money My Dear virtue Oh I have to prioritize but that is the case that I am
a man who is financially autonomous right but now it is a hut
the problem here is that I don't have to say the thing is that you have to be rich you have a wife but the problem
this is when you're poor the reason you used to be you don't have real money but you have to fight you're poor you have to
even if that girl sees herself as ok that poor guy he fights poorly but at least
then they saw it they loved it in the bar yes you still did it for me because he made 10 coins you still gave me food
having the bronze they still feed themselves with those 9 coins and not that he abandons himself at least that I still have the pleasure
believe that when this guy is rich this life is not but at least there is so called responsibility to
again a mate of his with it is so important that the problem is that the subject of post for him now it Stark from
the thing is that it is not the two sides of the family that the two themselves the postcard came from the two of them
that that two people accept to do it because each other changes together fight with each other that is something from the mind
thought they were changing is from thought rather than from Plan [music]
to have an ideal partner first we observe their persecution Monday is the family of
the third problem I think is that health is also an important factor Tuesday not because I see that
when you get married, people often take each other for a general test to see if one person or another has a disease.
whether or not you see this as a matter that matters so that you can choose a partner or
or you'll want your wife and yourself to go for those diseases but
it's not about giving up on each other and determining acceptance for example that your wife knows that your wife can't have children or
I know I'm not happy with my mouth suppose it wasn't because you couldn't
have children so I divorce you I go to find new people or you accept the adoption of other people's children I will not be like
and yet you know that you manage to let me then uh I accept that a childless life is now
now where am I going to get pleasure I'm going to get a dog here I'm going to go there here I can go get a baby here or I have one
those brothers and sisters who will give back to society for the return of sentiments must think for
you're healthy but it's not about giving up on each other but the last thing you're about being yourself
you'll be able to live with that you know what's wrong with your wife you'll be able to accept it and live together
every day and it will be happy that day so health is done agree but let them change not give up
it is true that after the conversation with Mr Duc led is finished, this is a husband that is very ideal for everyone
I like it and why there can be a beautiful love and love each other 9 years with marriage proposal but if there is a word
advise is certainly to ask each other for a general examination before we proceed to marriage with him the last factor
in the same appearance it needs to be that two people need to have the appearance and correspond to each other or disagree is foreign
the picture is important but when we fall in love we both try to change each other
it means to be very happy that every day you are different and you upgrade compared to yesterday in the process of loving one
the person you see is that person because the person who makes you love is really the person who makes you better every day
motivation is that right you look at the girl because I said with the mindset of walking out on the street I don't want to be embarrassed when you're around
because I don't want people to look at me to be beautiful and look at me people see why even though I know how to quit
a lot that many people like that kind of comment can not believe why you think so beautiful
if you love someone like that at first you hear you hurt but later I know that I will change
more change every day it has to change initially it is pressure but now it is a motivation I see
I like it so much that's the first thing the second thing Monday is that when I do it I use it
suppose I feel the worthiness and the worthiness of that appearance it proves to be the change of
I'll show you from my appearance that these two deserve to be together because if you change
change in the perception of cooking see where you change only two things one is the appearance or money but the appearance
the most conspicuous one looks at one sees Oh these two are old and nowadays very different surely we love
a lot of people do it in the end I feel like a person I really love and that's the right thing to do.
a person I love is the one who shows me that no matter what form she takes I renew it
I feel renewed love for her and I feel like I have no taste what I am she not
whatever I put out my grandfather, he told his children that it was after
if you are married you should not marry someone who is more than 15 years younger than yourself because it will be lost in the mindset you see
how about this in the past do not know the house as now you see all the same age maybe it Dalat
what is the same age you two talk about are two completely different types
so I think the problem is not how old it is if this is just the story that these two people have the same frequency with
love each other or not love each other or not love each other change or not like I'm 40 years old I love one
she's not 18 19 years old I said the story of work she doesn't understand I said Why do I need people to understand
it's only one thing that people understand right then I'm not okay people come people hug me one thing that's enough then at the end
the same is thinking it's different from each other finally whether the thinking you're related to work involves something unknown
But in the sentiment from long to late is that we all have only one mindset and you also need to be pampered nor
to be loved love a 40 year old man and love an 18 year old just like each other is also heart beating is also needed
being spoiled is no different [music]
Everyone is really a very thankful child in love as tool today meets Masters in marriage and love
love that you have a lot of new knowledge I am extremely surprised why today's conversation
I have also understood much more to what is an ideal partner of my first is to have a harmony of Soul
Monday Tuesday Tuesday is a person of virtue the third is that he needs to observe what his family is like the third
also is health good or not good health or not for what fast do I get the life it suits
each other and the last one is the appearance is how original you are
it doesn't matter if you two love each other let's argue together what's the smallest thing in general
what if I have a not very bright appearance then try to be refined for the ability to speak
because someone who is charming everyone pours when you remember like that today I have a gift called a house tree
the garden was for you because it was from the process that it ship to your house it was a little dark it was called a little crushed
but the gift inside it is very quality so hopefully you will know it
Young talented business boss now asking permission is to return him Nick led to his wife and now we
